            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 1.0 </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            The XML 1.0 language is created on February 10, 1998, mainly for data sharing between computers. However, the W3C sees XML as a possible solution to its HTML 4.01 interpretation problems by creating the XHTML 1.0 language (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language).
            XHTML 1.0 is the same as HTML 4.01 but with a document definition based on XML instead of SGML.
            Thus, a series of rules are dictated, the main one being that the XHTML 1.0 document must be a well-formed document. For this, rules are established such as that every element that has a start tag must necessarily have an end tag, that the names of the elements and attributes must be in lowercase, there cannot be attributes that have no value
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 2.0 </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            The IETF itself organizes an HTML working group, after the
            which, manages to publish, in September of that year, the standard known as HTML 2.0, being, despite its version 2.0, the first official standard of the HTML "language".

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 3.0 </h3>
             <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            Tim Berners would found the W3C (World Wide Web Consotium) in 1995 and shortly after the draft of the third version, HTML 3.0, emerged. This gave much more freedom of creation to the web designer.
            It made it easy to create tables, text could flow around figures, and complex mathematical elements were displayed. Its creators wanted it to be compatible with the previous version, but it was too complex for the browsers of the time to support it.
            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 3.2 </h3>
             <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            As of 1996, it is the W3C, an acronym for the World Wide Web Consortium, that publishes HTML standards. HTML version 3.2 was published in January 1997 and is the first official HTML recommendation published by that organization.

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 4.01 </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            The last official HTML specification was released on December 24, 1999 and is called HTML 4.01. This is a revision and update of the HTML 4.0 version, so it does not include significant new features.
            Since the release of HTML 4.01, HTML standardization activity stopped and the W3C focused on the development of the XHTML standard.
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 5.0 </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            The current activity of the WHATWG focuses on the future HTML5 standard, the first official draft of which was published on January 22, 2008.
            Due to the strength of the companies that make up the WHATWG group and the publication of HTML 5.0 drafts, in March 2007 the W3C decided to resume the standardizing activity of HTML.
            In parallel to its activity with HTML, W3C has continued with the standardization of XHTML, an advanced version of HTML and based on XML

            <h1>What is HTML? </h1> 
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
                HTML ( HyperText Markup Language ) is the most basic component of the Web. Defines the meaning and structure of web content. In addition to HTML, other technologies are generally used to describe the appearance/presentation of a web page ( CSS ) or the functionality/behavior ( JavaScript ).
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
                "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single web site or between web sites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the " World Wide Web ".

            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            In 1995 the HTML 2.0 standard is published. Despite its name, HTML 2.0 is the first official HTML standard, meaning HTML 1.0 did not exist as a standard. HTML 2.0 did not support tables.
            The structure of the document was simplified to the maximum to speed up its editing, where the explicit declaration of the body, html and head elements is optional.
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 3.2 </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            The HTML 3.2 version was published in 1997 and is the first HTML recommendation published by the W3C (International Consortium). This revision incorporated the latest developments in web pages developed up to 1996, such as Java applets and text flowing around images.

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 4.01 </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            The latest official HTML specification was published in December 1999 and is called HTML 4.01. Since the publication of HTML 4.01, the W3C focused on the development of the XHTML standard. For this reason, in 2004, the companies Apple, Mozilla and Opera expressed their concern about the lack of interest of the W3C in HTML and decided to organize themselves into a new association called WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) that began the development of the HTML 5, whose first official draft was published in January 2008. Due to the strength of the companies that make up the WHATWG group and the publication of the HTML 5.0 drafts, in March 2007 the W3C decided to resume the HTML standardization activity, within which he decided to integrate the XHTML.

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML5, HTML5.1, HTML5.2 </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            The international consortium W3C, after an evolution of several years, released HTML 5 as an official standard at the end of October 2014. HTML 5 incorporates new elements not contemplated in HTML 4.01. There are several changes from HTML 4.01. There are new labels, the possibility of inserting audio and video directly on the web without the need for plugins or add-ons in browsers, and other new features. The W3C will progressively release new evolutions of HTML 5.
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 4.01 Strict </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            In this type of document we can use HTML 4.01 tags, but obsolete tags are not accepted, that is, tags from older versions. It is the version that if we use in theory should give us an optimal result in the most modern browsers. This is not always the case, as we will explain a little later.
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 4.01 Transitional</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            All tags from all versions of HTML can be used in this type of document. Using this variant of HTML raises the question of whether it is okay to allow the use of deprecated tags that might stop working in future versions of browsers. However, this is the most used standard, because it combines the possibility of using older tags and more modern tags, so that we can aspire to a better display in most browsers.
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color:  #000066">HTML 4.01 Frameset</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px">
            This type of document has support for frames. Frames are frames in the form of small sub-windows within the same web page that were used a lot a few years ago but are used less and less today. This type of HTML can be considered old-fashioned, because there are other more modern and useful ways of designing web pages without frames that allow us to obtain the same result more efficiently.
